\paragraph{On the primacy words} Several linguistic studies suggest
that words, at least as delimited by whitespace in some writing
systems, are neither necessary nor sufficient units of linguistic
analysis. \newcite{Haspelmath:2011} claims that there is no
cross-linguistically valid definition of words \cite[see also][who
address specifically the notion of prosodic
word]{Schiering:etal:2010}. Others have stressed the difficulty of
characterizing words in polysynthetic languages
\cite{Bickel:Zuniga:2017}. Children are only rarely exposed to words
in isolation during learning
\cite{Tomasello:2003},\footnote{Single-word utterances are not
  uncommon in child-directed language, but they are still rather the
  exception than the rule, and many important words, such as
  determiners, never occur in isolation
  \cite{Christiansen:etal:2005}.} and it is likely that the units that
adult speakers end up storing in their lexicon are of variable size,
both smaller and larger than conventional words
\cite[e.g.,][]{Jackendoff:2002,Goldberg:2005}. % Our
% study shows that a powerful sequence learning device, such as an RNN
% with LSTM cells, can learn, from naturally occurring language data, to
% capture several linguistic phenomena that appear to be word-mediated
% without overt word-boundary information and lacking an internal data
% structure for a word vocabulary. The model, moreover, develops during
% learning units that track word-like boundaries, despite its lack of an
% explicit lexicon.
We hope our results will contribute to the theoretical
debate on word primacy, suggesting, through computational simulations, that
word priors are not crucial to language learning and processing.

\paragraph{Character-based neural language models} received attention in the last
decade because of their greater generality. % , and because, intuitively, they should be able to
% use cues, such as morphological information, that word-based models
% miss by design.
Early studies
\cite{Mikolov:etal:2011,Sutskever:etal:2011,DBLP:journals/corr/Graves13}
established that CNLMs might not be as good at language modeling as
their word-based counterparts, but lag only slightly behind (and
character-level sentence prediction involves a much larger search
space than predicting at the word
level). \newcite{Sutskever:etal:2011} and
\newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/Graves13} ran qualitative analyses showing
that CNLMs capture basic linguistic properties in their input. The
latter, who used LSTM cells, also showed, qualitatively, that CNLMs model
hierarchical structure. In particular, they balance parentheses
correctly when generating text. %
% Our aim here is to understand to what extent CNLMs trained on
% unsegmented input learn various linguistic constructs. % This differs

Most recent work in the area has focused on \emph{character-aware}
architectures combining character- and word-level information to
develop state-of-the-art language models that are also effective in
morphologically rich languages
\citep[e.g.,][]{Bojanowski:etal:2016,Kim:etal:2016,Gerz:etal:2018}. For
example, Kim and colleagues perform prediction at the word level, but
use a character-based convolutional network to generate word
representations. Other work focuses on splitting words into morphemes,
using character-level RNNs and an explicit segmentation objective
\cite[e.g.,][]{Kann:etal:2016}. These latter lines of work are only
distantly related to our interest in probing what network trained on
running text entirely at the character level has implicitly learned about
linguistic constituents and features.

\paragraph{Probing linguistic knowledge of neural language models} is
currently a popular research topic
\cite{Li:etal:2016,Linzen:etal:2016,Shi:etal:2016,Adi:etal:2017,Belinkov:etal:2017,Kadar:etal:2017,Hupkes:etal:2017,Conneau:etal:2018,Ettinger:etal:2018,Linzen:etal:2018}. Among
studies focusing on character-level models, already
\newcite{Elman:1990} reported a proof-of-concept experiment on
implicit learning of word
segmentation. \newcite{Christiansen:etal:1998} trained a RNN on
phoneme-level language modeling of transcribed child-directed speech
with tokens marking utterance boundaries, and found that the network
learned to segment the input by predicting the utterance boundary
symbol also at word edges. More recently, \newcite{Sennrich:2017}
explored the grammatical properties of character- and
subword-unit-level models that are used as components of a machine
translation system. He concluded that current character-based decoders
generalize better to unseen words, but capture less grammatical
knowledge than subword units. Still, his character-based systems
lagged only marginally behind the subword architectures on grammatical
tasks such as handling agreement and
negation. \newcite{DBLP:journals/corr/RadfordJS17} focused on CNLMs
deployed in the domain of sentiment analysis, where they found the
network to specialize a unit for sentiment tracking. We will discuss
below how our CNLMs also show single-unit specialization, but for boundary
tracking. \newcite{Godin:etal:2018} investigated the rules implicitly
used by supervised character-aware neural morphological segmentation
methods, finding linguistically sensible
patterns. \newcite{Alishahi:etal:2017} probed the linguistic knowledge
induced by a neural network that receives unsegmented acoustic
input. Focusing on phonology, they found that phonemic information is
processed at a fine-grained level by the lower layers of the model,
whereas higher layers are sensitive to more abstract
information. %Their model is not directly comparable to ours, since it
% uses a considerably more complex architecture and it is trained on
% multimodal data.
\newcite{Kementchedjhieva:Lopez:2018} recently probed the linguistic
knowledge of an English CNLM trained with whitespace in the
input. Their results are aligned with ours. The model is sensitive to
lexical and morphological structure, and it captures morphosyntactic
categories as well as constraints on possible morpheme
combinations. Intriguingly, the model tracks word/morpheme boundaries
through a single specialized unit, suggesting that such boundaries are
salient (at least when marked by whitespace, as in their experiments)
and informative enough that it is worth for the network to devote a
special mechanism to track them. We replicated this finding for our
networks trained on whitespace-free text, as discussed in Section
\ref{sec:segmentation} below, where we discuss it in the context of our
other results.

%We were not able to find a similar sparse
%encoding of morpheme- or word-boundaries in our network (the results
%we will report in Section \ref{sec:segmentation} suggest that our
%model is also tracking boundaries in its hidden state, but through a
%distributed code). The most obvious difference between our experiment
%and that of Kementchedjhieva and Lopez is that they keep whitespace in
%the input training.  However, they observe that their
%morpheme-tracking unit is not simply predicting white space,
%suggesting that the encoding difference between our model and theirs
%cannot be (entirely) explained away by the difference in training
%input. As we do not attempt here to characterize the inner dynamics of
%our network, we leave a systematic comparison to future work.


% They do not explore syntactic or semantic
% knowledge, and they limit their study to English. Moreover, they
% trained their models on input with whitespace, thus providing the
% model with a major (and cognitively artificial) cue to word
% boundaries.
