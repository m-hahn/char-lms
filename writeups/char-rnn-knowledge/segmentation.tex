\subsection{Word segmentation}
\label{sec:segmentation}


We tested whether our CNLM developed an implicit notion of word, despite not being endowed with a hard-coded word dictionary, and being exposed to unsegmented input. %



\newcite{Kementchedjhieva:Lopez:2018} found a unit that tracks morpheme boundaries


We randomly chose 10,000 positions from the training set

We then looked for the 

For each language, we found at least 5 neurons with strong correlations ($>0.5$).
For the RNN, we also found at least one neuron with correlations > 0.4.


The behavior of these units on sample sequences from the development partition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:word-unit}.
Qualitatively, the neuron consistently shows high activation on word boundaries.
In the German snippet, we see peaks at the morpheme boundaries of the compound \emph{Haupt-auf-gabe}.

To investigate how consistently this word unit corresponds to word boundaries, we trained a threshold classifier on this single neuron (i.e., a classifier with a single parameter) on 1,000 positions from the development set, using the remainder as test data.


We chose word unit on subset of training data, and trained \& evaluated threshold classifier on validation data.

How much information is contained in the entire hidden state?




probing: at the end of a word (and/or the first char of a word)

- CNLM (LSTM, RNN)

- lexicon-based: this is the best one could do when (1) knowing where the word starts, (2) isn't given the prior context. Note that this baseline has access to a very large lexicon


We applied the method of diagnostic classifiers to investigate whether the CNLM's internal states encode knowledge about word boundaries.

While running the CNLM, we randomly selected positions, such that half of these were the last character of a token, and the other half were not.
We collected 100, 1000, and 1000 such points as training data, and as many as possible as test data, from the development partitions of the corpora.
Both sets were balanced between (1) and (2).
We sampled the test data points subject to the constraint that the word or prefix ending at the selected character does not overlap with the training set.


We compared this to the following lexicon-based classifier:
Given a position where the last word is $x_1...x_n$, we count how often $x_1...x_n$ occurs as a token in the tokenized Wikipedia training set ($N_1$), and how often a longer word starting with $x_1...x_n$ occurs there ($N_2$).
The classifier guesses that a boundary is present if $N_1 > N_2$, and that no boundary is present if $N_1 < N_2$, and guesses randomly if $N_1 = N_2$.
This is a very strong classifier:
First, unlike the CNLM, it has oracle access to the beginning of the current word.
With this, it represents the \emph{optimal} classifier for this task when the beginning of the current word is known, but the prior context is not given.
Second, it has access to a very large lexicon listing all unigram counts in the training corpus, encoding a vast amount of lexical knowledge and proper names.
It seems that the only way a CNLM-based classifier could be more successful than this classifier is by drawing on the prior context.



accuracy


We find that the diagnostic classifier shows above-random performance with few training samples.
With 1000 training samples, it performs similarly to the strong lexicon-based classifier.

This shows that the CNLM's representations provide strong cues regarding word boundaries.

Performance is strongest in English and weakest in German, both for the CNLM-based diagnostic classifier and for the lexicon-based baseline.
The preponderance of compound words in German may be responsible for this.

(error analysis)


the pointwise mutual
information (PMI) between left and right contexts, computed by
subtracting the unconditional log-likelihood of the next 20 characters
from their log-likelihood conditioned on the prior context

Interestingly, the CNLM-generated cues we used for word segmentation
also cue constituents larger than words. To illustrate this, we created constituency trees for the German
validation set using the Berkeley Parser~\cite{petrov2007improved}, using the provided German model\footnote{https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser}.
For each character in the data, we counted its hierarchical distance
from the preceding character, operationalized as the number of
intervening closing and opening brackets.  This number is zero if both characters belong to the same word, 1 at word
boundaries, larger at larger-constituent boundaries. Figure~\ref{fig:syntax-depth} plots CNLM-based PMI by
hierarchical distance, for all distances for which at least 1,000
data-points occurred in the data-set.  The plot shows that longer
hierarchical distance between neighboring characters correspond to
lower average PMI, generalizing the finding for word boundaries.  This
illustrates how it is useful for segmentation knowledge to be
implicit, as the model can discover about different kinds of
boundaries in a continuous manner.

%% (whitespace), if it is distilling meaningful linguistic knowledge, we

%Based on these considerations, we tested the model segmentation
%capabilities as follows. We used the development sets to
%train  logistic classifiers predicting whether a character is first in
%a word or not, based on the following features, derived from the
%pre-trained CNLMs without further tuning: (1) \emph{surprisal}, the
%log-probability of the character given prior context, (2)
%\emph{entropy} of the distribution over the character given prior
%context, (3) \emph{context PMI}, that is, the total
% likelihood of the next 20 characters, minus the unconditional
% likelihood estimated by starting the CNLM at the current position. %
%%The rationale of (3) is that it measures the pointwise mutual information, and thus the statistical association, between the subsequent characters and the prior context, which we hypothesize will be higher inside words.
%%It is also the transition probability for the next characters
%%(3) can also be interpreted as the result of normalizi transition probability
% We collected these quantities for each position and the preceding
% and following three characters, resulting in a 21-feature classifier. %
%%In total, the classifier has 21 coefficients.
%We repeated the  experiment with features extracted from a
%character-level 8-gram model estimated on the training set, closer to
% earlier non-neural work

%
%How does the LSTM compare to \emph{ad-hoc} word segmentation models?
%We look at the Bayesian bigram model of
%\newcite{goldwater-bayesian-2009}, an elegant approach using a
%hierarchical Dirichlet process.  The latter, unlike our method, is
%unsupervised, but it has a specifically designed built-in bias towards
%a discrete lexicon with a power-law frequency distribution. Note that,
%while supervised, our model is rather parameter-lean, consisting in a
%logistic classifier trained on 21 features.
%%Moreover, unlike standard supervised word segmentation methods, our
%%classifier does not have direct access to character strings; instead,
%%it evaluates how strongly quantities computed by the CNLM
%%\emph{correlate} with word boundaries. \textbf{Not sure I got the
%%  latter point.}
%
%Running Bayesian methods on Wikipedia dumps is computationally
%unfeasible. We re-trained instead the LSTM (with fixed
%hyperparameters) on the Brent corpus of English child-directed speech
%\cite{brent-efficient-1999} also used by Goldwater and colleagues.  We
%used 90\% to train our language model, 5\% to fit the logistic
%classifier, and 5\% for evaluating both the classifier and the Bayesian model on word segmentation.
%The Bayesian
%model is trained %and evaluated
%on the full data-set, as it does not
%rely on word boundary information during training. Results in
%Table~\ref{tab:segmentation-results-brent} show that the CNLM
%performance is comparable to that of the sophisticated Bayesian
%segmentation method.
%%\footnote{We found very similar results when
%%testing the Bayesian model only on the subset used to test  our logistic classifier.}

%word segmentation probing task:

%- LSTM, RNN probing
%
%
%We looked at common errors made by the English CNLM-based segmenter. Considering first the 30 most common undersegmentations
%in the test set (that is, cases in which the model failed to split two
%or more words): About half (16) are function word
%sequences that could reasonably be re-analyzed as single words (e.g.,
%\emph{more than}, \emph{as well as}, \emph{such as}). Of the remaining
%cases, 8 follow the \emph{N of} pattern, where \emph{N} is a
%(typically relational) noun commonly occurring in this construction
%(\emph{member of}, \emph{end of}, \emph{part of}\ldots). There are 3
%fixed multi-word expressions (\emph{New York}, \emph{United States}
%and \emph{high school}). The final undersegmentations \emph{based on}, \emph{known as} and
%\emph{according to} can be seen as lexicalized connectives,
%especially in the Wikipedia text the model was trained on.
%
%The picture is murkier but still fairly linguistically grounded
%for the 30 most common oversegmentation errors (that is, character
%fragments that are wrongly segmented from inside the largest number of
%distinct words).\footnote{We ignore here single-letter segmentations,
%  that would otherwise account for one third of the most-frequent
%  set.}  More than half (17) are common affixes (prefixes such as
%\emph{re} and \emph{de} or suffixes such as \emph{ing} and
%\emph{ly}). 3 strings identical to frequent
%function words were wrongly carved out of longer words (\emph{the},
%\emph{to} and \emph{on}). %
%% , although the model might be treating the
%% latter as a pseudo-suffix in forms such as \emph{Peterson} and
%% \emph{Creighton}).
%The strings \emph{land} and \emph{man} are not unreasonably segmented
%out of compounds. It's hard to find a linguistically sound motivation
%for the 8 remaining top oversegmentations, that are, intriguingly, all CV
%syllables (\emph{la, le, ma, na, ra, ro, se, ta}).
%
%% To conclude, we reiterate that knowledge about word segmentation is
%% only implicit in our CNLM, and indeed the same CNLM-generated cues we
%% relied upon to build our classifier above are actually tracking
%% boundaries between linguistic constituents of different depth.
